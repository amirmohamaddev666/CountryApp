# 🌍 Country Info App

A clean and interactive country search web app that allows users to quickly find useful information about any country. By entering a country name, the app fetches real-time data from a public API and displays details such as the national flag, capital city, population, currency, and commonly spoken languages. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on simplicity, responsive design, and smooth user experience. It was created to practice working with APIs, handling asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch), and dynamic DOM manipulation while building a modern and visually appealing interface.
